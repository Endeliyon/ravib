Banshee
=======

RAVIB is a PHP webapplication, which uses a MySQL/MariaDB database. It is built upon the Banshee PHP framework (https://www.banshee-php.org/). Follow these steps to install RAVIB.

Configure your webserver
------------------------
Use the directory 'public' as the webroot directory and allow PHP execution. If you use the Hiawatha webserver, you must use the following UrlToolkit configuration:

	UrlToolkit {
		ToolkitID = banshee
		RequestURI isfile Return
		Match ^/(css|files|fonts|images|js)($|/) Return
		Match ^/(favicon.ico|robots.txt)$ Return
		Match [^?]*(\?.*)? Rewrite /index.php$1
	}

For Apache, there is a .htaccess file in the 'public' directory which contains the required URL rewriting rules.
To upload files and create directories via the CMS Apache needs permission in the public/files folder.

Configure PHP
-------------
Banshee needs the MySQL and XML/XSLT PHP module. Use the following PHP settings:

	allow_url_include = Off
	cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0 (when using FastCGI PHP), 1 (otherwise)
	date.timezone = <your timezone>
	magic_quotes_gpc = Off
	register_globals = Off

Configure your database
-----------------------
Open the website in your browser and follow the instructions on your screen.

Configure Cronjob
-----------------
Configure cronjob to run the scripts send_deadline_warnings and database/backup_database once per day.

Configure Banshee
-----------------
Go to the Settings page in the CMS and replace the present e-mail addresses with your own. Before going live, set the DEBUG_MODE flag in settings/website.conf to 'no'.
